                <p><strong>It wasn't always called Flow</strong>; in fact, it used to be called <em>Cater</em>.</p>

                <p>Cater has been around since BlackBerry's humble beginnings with 10 years of development before finally launching in 2001. And what began as a small project has grown into something much, much bigger.</p>

                <p>The platform was conceived to address BlackBerry's need for a business process management and modelling platform &mdash; a place where processes and workflows could be designed to allow data to be <em>intelligently stored, easily accessed, and audited</em>. A place where workflows could be analyzed to <em>eliminate inefficiencies</em>, and where reports and dashboards could be created to <em>identify trends and measure performance</em>.</p>

                <p>The platform is a corporate solution that was developed in-house and provides a <em>zero cost data management and reporting tool</em> to the employees of BlackBerry.</p>


                <ol class="list">
                    <p class="list--header">The idea is simple.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Within the platform, you have applications.</strong> Each application is siloed and independent of other applications. Links, however, can be created to connect related or sub-applications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Within each application, you have records.</strong> A record contains data pertaining to the nature and purpose of the application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Within each application, you have a summarized view of records.</strong> The summary lists out the application's records (usually in a table) and can have complex queries performed on it to filter and sort the dataset.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Within each application, you can generate reports and dashboards.</strong> A report or dashboard can contain tables and a wide assortment of graphs pertaining to an individual application's data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>You can create and edit records.</strong> The creation/edit form for records is generated based on the application's form specifications. Forms can be designed with grouped fields under sections, a multitude of field types, dynamic dropdowns, file and link attachments, status-based rules that affect whether a field is visible or disabled, and more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>You can approve/reject records.</strong> For applications that are configured with an approval process, decisions can be made by the appropriate stakeholders to progress a record through its workflow.
                    </li>

                    <p class="list--footer">
                        This barely brushes the surface of the platform's features and specifications but should suffice as a quick overview.

                </ol>

                <p>It started with one.</p>

                <p>Cater was constructed to serve and, well, <em>cater</em> to the needs of this one application.</p>

                <p>Over time, this one application became two, then ten, and then a hundred. In its glory days, Cater was home to roughly 300 unique and actively used applications.</p>

                <p>News of the platform spread like wildfire when it was first launched and this led many different groups within the company to adopt Cater as their data management solution. While this was great in terms of growth, this also led to a number of engineering oversights that were left unattended to.</p>

                <p>Until now.</p>
