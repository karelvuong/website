Primarily, this is to serve as a reference to myself to illustrate how very elements of a blog post will look. If however, you are interested in how I have styled them, feel free to read on.

# h1

Above is a very impressive header. It should only be used for the title of the post.

## h2

This is cool as well. Use it for sections within the post.

### h3

Can't really find a use case for this.

#### h4

A little small, forget you for now.

##### h5

Too small.

###### h6

... goodbye.

## Links:

These are links! [Twitter][twitter] and [GitHub][github] are places I frequent often.

1. Make a website
2. Make it look nice
3. Profit

## Code Snippets:

A little bit of HTML, some CSS, and a pinch of pygments = `Some inline code`. Pretty snazzy, huh?

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
